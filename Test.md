Azure DevOps (ADO) provides development services for teams to plan work, collaborate on code development, and build and deploy applications. Through agile work item/project management, version control (Git), automated build and release management (CICD), reporting and test management capabilities, ADO enables teams with the tools and services they need for the entire application lifecycle management process.
We manage two different instances of ADO for the enterprise:
**ADOC (Cloud)**: Azure DevOps SaaS- [https://dev.azure.com/AmericanAirlines/](https://dev.azure.com/AmericanAirlines/)
**ADOS (on-prem)**: Azure DevOps on-premises -  [https://azuredevops.aa.com/](https://azuredevops.aa.com/) 
_**All new ADO onboardings will go to **ADOC**. _

ADO is very flexible in how it can be leveraged, teams can choose to use as much or little of the components they want or need. It also seamlessly integrates with other tools like GitHub, Artifactory, Cherwell, Coverity, and more.
